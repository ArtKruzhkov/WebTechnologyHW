    <h2>Breed origin</h2>
    <p class="breedorigin"><b>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</b> is descended from Vallhunds, Swedish cattle dogs that were brought to Wales by the Vikings in the 9th and 10th centuries. Others think they may have been descended from dogs that were brought to Wales by Flemish weavers in the 12th century.
        Either way, the breed has a rather misty historical pedigree. Farmers who kept working dogs in the past bred the best dogs for the jobs they wanted them to do. They didn’t keep good records about the matings.
        In the 1920s, the UK Kennel Club recognized Corgis as purebred dogs. They were officially known <b><i>as Welsh Corgis</i></b> when exhibited for the first time in 1925. At that time, Pembrokes and Cardigans were shown in the same class as one breed.
        Then, in 1934, the Kennel Club recognized the Pembroke and the Cardigan as two separate breeds. In that same year, the American Kennel Club followed suit. Pembrokes were first shown in the U.S. in 1936.</p>
    <h2>Pembroke Corgi size</h2>
    <p>Pembroke Welsh Corgis are between 10 and 12 inches tall at the shoulders, and weigh <i>no more than 30 pounds.</i></p>
